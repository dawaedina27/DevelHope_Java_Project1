1. Create Person class, it should have name, age, username, password. Override toString function to just print name and age in a good format. Override equals function to check username and   password.
2. Create Customer class, it should extend Person  class and it should have extra customerID(auto genarate we will not have it on constructor) and balance.

Required extra functions: getBalance, setBalance and getCustomerID

Overide toString again and print extra customerID
override equals function and check if username and password matchs or customerID and password match.  IF any of cases are correct we will return true.

3. Create Manager class, it should extend Person, it should have extra managerId (auto generate) and actionNumber( set zero when you created the object so it should assign 0 in the constructor)

//        Required extra functions: getActionNumber, setActionNumber and getManagerID

//        Overide toString again and print extra managerID
override equals function and check if username and password matchs or managerIDand password match.  IF any of cases are correct we will return true.
